"Symmetry refers to a line that splits an object in half and, if both sides of the object are an exact mirror image of each other, then this object is said to be symmetrical. The line that splits a symmetrical object is called the line of symmetry. Symmetry is a powerful tool that lets you automatically create harmony and a sense of aesthetically pleasing balance and proportion in a photograph.\n\nThere are two types of symmetry:\n1. Vertical Line of Symmetry (VLS): If an object’s line of symmetry is perpendicular to the horizon line, it has a vertical line of symmetry. \n2. Horizontal Line of Symmetry (HLS): If an object’s line of symmetry is parallel to the horizon line, it has a horizontal line of symmetry." = "Symmetry refers to a line that splits an object in half and, if both sides of the object are an exact mirror image of each other, then this object is said to be symmetrical.

"The rule of thirds involves dividing up your image using 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines, as shown below. You then position the important elements in your scene along those lines, or at the points where they meet. \n\nThe idea is that an off-centre composition is more pleasing to the eye and looks more natural than one where the subject is placed right in the middle of the frame. It also encourages you to make creative use of negative space, the empty areas around your subject." = "The rule of thirds involves dividing up your image using 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines, as shown below.
